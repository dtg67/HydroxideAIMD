# HydroxideAIMD

This program takes a CP2K trajectory output, 
processed by VMD AIMD simulation of a single 
hydroxide anion and water molecules as an input 
and:
    1. Identifies the hydroxide anion
    2. Produces coordination numbers
    3. Produces a dataframe identifying
        water residues and hydroxide anion
